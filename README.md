# Introduction
This project involved scraping and analyzing data from various sources related to Mars. In the first part of the project, I scraped the titles and preview text of news articles from the Mars News website. In the second part, I scraped and analyzed Mars weather data, which existed in a table. The aim was to strengthen my skills in collecting, organizing, storing, analyzing data, and then visually communicating my insights.

# Project Overview
## Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News

* Used automated browsing to visit the Mars News site and extracted HTML code using Beautiful Soup
* Scraped and extracted the titles and preview text of the news articles
* Stored the scraped information in a Python data structure - a list of dictionaries
* Exported the scraped data to a JSON file

## Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
* Used automated browsing to visit the Mars Temperature Data Site and extracted HTML code using Beautiful Soup
* Scraped and assembled the data into a Pandas DataFrame
* Analyzed the data to answer several questions related to Mars weather such as how many months exist on Mars, how many Martian days' worth of data there are, which month on average has the lowest/highest temperature/atmospheric pressure, and how many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year
* Created data visualizations to support the analysis
* Exported the DataFrame to a CSV file

# Tools Used
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* Beautiful Soup
* Splinter
* Matplotlib

# What I Learned
Through this project, I gained valuable experience in web scraping and data analysis. I learned how to use automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup to extract information from web pages. I also improved my data manipulation and analysis skills using Pandas and data visualization skills using Matplotlib.

# Conclusion
This project was a great learning experience in scraping and analyzing data related to Mars. I was able to apply my skills in Python, Pandas, Beautiful Soup, and Matplotlib to extract and analyze information from various sources. Overall, this project has helped me strengthen my skills in collecting, organizing, storing, analyzing data, and visually communicating my insights.
